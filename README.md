After learning React basics it was time to build something.
I got inspired by wordle game [https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle).
And decided to build same thing, but in my game word changes everytime when lose or win.

## Compatibility

Now it is playable only on desktop.

Happy playing!
